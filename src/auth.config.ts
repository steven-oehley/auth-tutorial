// NextAuth configuration is split into multiple files because:
// 1. Some ORM/database libraries aren't compatible with Edge runtime
// 2. Using JWT strategy instead of database strategy for Edge compatibility
// 3. This prevents database access attempts in Edge environments like middleware

// While Auth.js strictly uses standard Web APIs (and thus can run in any environment that supports them),
// some libraries or ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) packages that you rely on might not be ready yet.
// In this case, you can split the auth configuration into multiple files.
// Auth.js supports two session strategies. When you are using an adapter,
// it will default to the database strategy. Unless your database and its adapter is compatible with the Edge
// runtime/infrastructure, you will not be able to use the "database" session strategy.
// So for example, if you are using an adapter that relies on an ORM/library that is not yet
// compatible with Edge runtime(s) below is an example where we force the jwt strategy and split up the configuration
// so the library doesnâ€™t attempt to access the database in edge environments, like in the middleware.

// necessary as prisma adapter is not compatible with edge runtime
